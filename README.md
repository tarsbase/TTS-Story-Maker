# What is it?
TTS (Text-to-Speech) Story Maker is an app that allows you to make stories, and have your computer read it to you, In different voices.

# How do I write stories?
Well, it's actually super easy. TTS Stories are basically dialogue, spoken one after the other. 

These dialogue lines are called "scenes", each of which are made with one speaking character and one dialogue line. 

Here's an example of a simple scene:

\# comments look like this
Evelyn:               (Speaker)
Where did they go?    (Dialogue)

# How do I change their voice and/or portrait?
Characters can be assigned with their custom voice and portrait through the "New Character" menu. 

You can create a new character by clicking on the "+" button on the sidebar. Or, if you prefer using the menubar, click on "Story" then "Add Character".

# How can I add more voices?
TTS Story Maker uses your Mac device's "Speech' voices for your characters. 

To add new voices to your Mac, go to System Preferences->Accessibility->Speech. There's a drop-down menu called "System Voice", click on it, then on customise. Choose the voices you want to install then click "Ok".
